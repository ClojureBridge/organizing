There are a lot of different ways to organize a workshop, but if you've got the [[Minimum Viable Workshop]], you'll have a great time. There are way more people in the world who are excited to teach and learn Clojure than you know.

The [[Workshop Planning Timeline]] is a good place to start; it's divided into sections before, during, and after the workshop. There are *a lot* of individual tasks, so we recommend organizing in a team.

We have past organizers who can help you figure out what to do. Email info@clojurebridge.org and we'll introduce you to an organizing mentor!

[[Resources on Diversity]] provides a number of great resources on how to create a diverse, inclusive event.

ClojureBridge follows the BridgeFoundry [Code of Conduct](http://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct/).
