## When You Sign Up

### <a name="joinlistserve"/>Join the organizer's listserve
If you haven't already, join: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojurebridge-workshops. You can email the list with questions, requests, panic, or jokes. We're all here to help.

### <a name="confirmvenue"/>Confirm dates & details with the hosting venue
You'll want to confirm that the dates work for them, how much room they have (which you will use to guide the RSVP cap on Eventbrite), and lots of other details. So many, in fact, that we have a whole separate page: [hosting venue questions](Hosting-venue-questions.md).

### <a name="meetmentor"/>Meet your mentor
If this is your first time organizing, the meta-organizers will set you up with a mentor to answer questions as they arise. Say hello now, in person or in the ether!

### <a name="calendarlisting"/>Add your event to the ClojureBridge events website

Please see the [Workshops](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/Workshops) repo for details. You will need to create a GitHub issue in that repo using the template provided.

### <a name="clojure.org"/>Submit a pull request to clojure/clojure-site

Upcoming events are displayed at [clojure.org/community/events](http://clojure.org/community/events). The Clojure website is backed by a Git repository which lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/clojure/clojure-site).

Before submitting a pull request to clojure/clojure-site you must sign the [Clojure Contributor Agreement](http://clojure.org/community/contributing_site#contributor).

Create a file similar to [clojurebridge\_berlin.adoc](https://github.com/clojure/clojure-site/commit/b1c8aed9430e24682f8286f83973b7dab5c66efa#diff-99d8e8fcb89e3797945e1248e063941c) then submit a pull request. When the pull request is merged the event will appear on the Clojure website.

### <a name="bridgetroll"/>Post the event on Eventbrite

You can use whatever event hosting system you'd like, but most organizers have used Eventbrite.

Copy an old workshop, update the details with your own, and have someone else read through it before posting. Because most people forget to update at least one piece of information, to various levels of tragedy.

Eventbrite can be used to
 * Record and modify RSVPs for Students and Volunteers
 * Email all students and/or volunteers
 * Create signup sheets for students and volunteers on Installfest and Workshop days

_In the week before the event, send pings to your students through Eventbrite to remind them that they can return to Eventbrite to modify their RSVP, class level preference, dietary and child care needs._

### <a name="survey"/>Survey the students and volunteers

Eventbrite can handle all pre-workshop surveying of students and volunteers.

### <a name="catering"/>Arrange catering

As you are getting quotes for the catering, check out the [sample budget|sample budget](sample budget|sample budget.md). Totals will vary depending on the number of folks there and where you're getting the food, but you shouldn't spend more than $1,500 for the whole workshop.

### Installfest
Installfest food is pizza and hopefully salad. If the host has a beer fridge or kegerator to share, that's awesome, otherwise, get some beer, too.

Amounts: 2-3 slices of pizza (20 inch) for each anticipated individual.
(I.e. Total Volunteers + Attendees = 80, 60% = 48: Roughly 144 slices needed- so 9 pizzas with 16 slices)

### Breakfast
Workshop breakfast is usually coffee & bagels. Arrange to have everything delivered about 15 minutes before Volunteers arrive, so there is food and coffee to greet them.

Search around the workshop’s location to find a coffee shop which will deliver it to you, if possible.  Not everyone will drink, but make sure to have plenty as many will refill their cups throughout the day. Remember to request extra cups & cream.

### Lunch

Ask the host location if they have any recommendations for catering companies that they have used before.
Give the Caterer estimated head count; usually 70% of that number of Yes RSVPs. Ask for a Vegetarian/Vegan option for about a third of the food, and if they will want help clearing away any of the set-up they bring. You can save some money if one of the organizers has a car and is willing to return the dishes to the company after the event.

If lunch will be delivered, please make sure they come at least 30 minutes beforehand so you & your team have time to set up.  When setting up, try to make sure the food is accessible by many at the same time (perhaps various stations?) as lunch time goes by so fast.

###  <a name="cookies"/>Clojure cookies
We have a history of having cookies with the Clojure logo printed on them so students can "take a bite out of Clojure." These can get expensive, though, so make sure you have enough sponsorship before you order these. Most bakeries can do logo cookies.

### <a name="afterparty"/>Make after-party reservations
It’s always great to thank volunteers for their time and help with a free drink after the event. This also gives the workshop goers a chance to socialize more and really build some networking connections that will help support them if they decide they now have the bug and want to actually delve into this awesome world of Clojure programming!

Find someplace close. The closer the after-party is to the workshop site, the more likely it is that people won’t get lost or distracted between workshop and party. A deserted bar is ideal, a casual restaurant is also good. Most workshops end at 4:30 or so on Saturdays, which tends to be a slow time for bars and restaurants, but it pays to check.

Make arrangements with the location ahead of time. If you can tell a place that X many people will be coming and you will buy Y many drinks (one for each of your volunteers), that’s often enough to encourage them to go out of their way to support what you’re doing. Some places will offer specials (free drinks, extra food) to entice large groups but even those that don’t should be informed before a horde of people descend on them.

Mention the after-party early and often. The more times you mention the fact and location of the after party the less likely it is that people don’t come because they don’t know about it.

If a potential host demands a minimum bar tab or rental fee, go elsewhere! Plenty of places don’t, but some places are in the business of hosting parties. This tends to run $1000 and up, which is too expensive unless you have an after-party sponsor.

###  <a name="trainteachers"/>Train the teachers
Set up a teacher training. This often happens during the week of the workshop. If you can't get a separate evening, you can do it during the Installfest, but try to get extra volunteers if you do that. Don't want to leave the student high and dry while teachers discuss best practices.

Take a look at the teacher training slides, which live at [http://docs.railsbridge.org/workshop/more_teacher_training](http://docs.railsbridge.org/workshop/more_teacher_training).

This is very important, and we *strongly* recommend that you do this, in person, ahead of the actual workshop.

From Sean, the organizer of the first San Francisco workshop:

"[The training slide deck] has a few parts that are RailsBridge-specific but most of it is about how to encourage a safe, welcoming environment for learning, and how to ensure TAs are prepared to help everyone get the most out of the workshop: how to get students engaged, how to deal with potential issues before they escalate, how to make sure everyone is happy and learning, and not getting frustrated.

Yes, it's yet one more thing to organize on everyone's calendar, and it means one more space to find a host for and more food/drink to pay for but it really is absolutely worth the effort! Trust me, it made a huge difference for us in San Francisco!"

### <a name="communicate"/>Communicate with everyone
A few of the things you'll do:
* Send Installfest instructions to attendees
* Send logistical info (detailed schedule, parking info, etc.)
* Ask people at every turn to update their RSVP on Eventbrite if they can't come or if their info needs changing.

You can find templates for emails in the [materials section](Templates-and-Materials.md) under "Communication".


### <a name="childcare"/>Arrange childcare
* Anecdotally, few people take you up on childcare; more people tend to use nursing/pumping space, actually.
* It's worth checking with the people who said they needed childcare to make sure they still really do. Many do not realize that you really will provide it if they ask, and will try and make other arrangements after requesting it. Check in with them as soon as you can after the initial request to confirm.

Here are two resources you could use for finding childcare providers:
* http://conferencechildcare.com/
* https://www.urbansitter.com/

### <a name="objects"/>Obtain necessary objects: power cords, flash drives, name tags, pens, etc.

### <a name="swagbags"/>Swag bags
If sponsors have given books or other giveaway goods, collect those items and bags in which to distribute them. Eric Normand has very generously offered his Intro to Clojure LispCast videos free of charge to ClojureBridge students, teachers, TAs, and organizers. So get in touch with him to find out how to distribute those: [http://purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure](http://purelyfunctional.tv/intro-to-clojure).


### <a name="slides"/>Update the pre- and post-workshop presentation slides
* Templates and instructions live in [Templates and Materials](Templates-and-Materials.md)

### <a name="levels"/>Figure out student class levels
* Use the set up a rough guesstimate of number of groups and sizes. It is very helpful to arrange the sections again the night before, after everyone has checked in at the installfest; that way you have a much better idea of what your actual workshop attendance will be.
